## Activity Labels

* `walking`: subject was walking during the test
* `walking_upstairs`: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `walking_downstairs`: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `sitting`: subject was sitting during the test
* `standing`: subject was standing during the test
* `laying`: subject was laying down during the test

## Information regarding the cleaning of the data

* `data.table` was used for faster selection of columns by using a 
logical vector (`index_mean_sd`).
* `stringr` and `dplyr` was used in order to shorten 
the steps in detecting the patterns subsetting the data 
based on the patterns. These packages were also used to 
remove the unnecessary patterns in the names of the measurements.
In particular, "-" and "()" were removed from the names of 
the measurements. The camel cases of the names of the measurements 
were retained to make them more readable.
* The type of activity was re-written in lower case letters.
* `tidyr` and `dplyr` were used for transforming the data to 
long format and back to tidy format to facilitate calculations of the
means.
